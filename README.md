## Laboration 2 - User based content

# Wheekr

**MERN-STACK (MongoDB + Express.js + React.js + Node.js)**  

*Wheekr is like twitter for guinea pig lovers!  
This is a lightweight social media platform where users can sign up and make posts to a newsfeed.  
Password encryption is supported*

To administrate users an admin-account is needed.  
To become an admin, change user access to "admin" in the database.
Then click on the cog-wheel in the header!
